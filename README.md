Insertion Sort Algorithm (JavaScript)

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.

## Description

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively placing elements in their correct positions within a sorted subarray.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `insertionSort.js` file.
3. Modify the `arr` array to contain the elements you want to sort.
4. Run the script using a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js) to see the sorted array.

## Example

```javascript
let arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6];
insertionSort(arr);
console.log("Sorted array:", arr);
